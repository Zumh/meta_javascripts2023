### Programming in js.

- JavaScript is used in various scenarios, such as in browsers to add interactivity, like updating a shopping cart when a button is clicked.
- On the server, it powers websites, communicates with databases, and provides functionality to web applications.
- JavaScript is used to build mobile apps using technologies like React Native and to program Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
- JavaScript is prevalent in modern technology, with diverse use cases, leading to different implementations tailored to specific problems.
- In the past, compatibility issues between different browsers resulted in developers having to write separate JavaScript code for each browser.
- The library named jQuery emerged as a solution to browser incompatibility, allowing developers to write code that worked across all browsers.
- jQuery became the most popular JavaScript library for over a decade.
- As web development evolved, new challenges arose, leading to the development of new solutions like React, which had a significant impact on website development.
- Other technologies and frameworks like Knockout, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Vue, and Alpine also emerged to address web development issues.
- Legacy code, including old jQuery implementations, can still be found in many existing projects.
- It's not necessary for beginners to master all JavaScript technologies; they should focus on mastering the basics of plain JavaScript without frameworks before delving into specific frameworks like React.

### JS TUT
#### Comments in JavaScript:

- Comments are essential for developers to add explanations and notes to their code.
- Two types of comments in JavaScript: single-line comments and multi-line comments.
- Single-line comments are created using double forward-slash (//) and are ignored by the browser.
- Multi-line comments, created with /* and */, span multiple lines and also ignore code.
- Writing comments empowers developers by facilitating communication, explanations, and making code more understandable.
- Comments can be used for various purposes like marking code for future tasks or debugging.
#### The Semicolon in JavaScript:

- Semicolons (;) in JavaScript serve to separate different parts of the code.
- There is an "Automatic Semi-colon Insertion" feature in browsers that adds semicolons automatically in certain cases.
- Some developers argue that adding semicolons is optional, while others prefer to use them for clarity.
- The choice of using semicolons in JavaScript is somewhat of a stylistic preference.
#### Using the Console in the Browser:

- JavaScript can be executed in a browser's Developer Tools Console, making it accessible and approachable for learning.
- The console allows you to type and run JavaScript code.
- You can use the console.log function to display output in the console.
- The console.log function can be styled using CSS for customized output.
- Adding %c before the text allows you to apply CSS styles to the text you output.
- You can use the console to practice writing and styling different words for fun and learning.
#### Output Multiple Words in the Console:

- To output multiple words in the console, you can join them using the + operator or separate them with commas.
- The + operator concatenates text, while commas separate text in the output.
- Examples show how to join or separate multiple text pieces in the console output.
- These points cover essential concepts for writing JavaScript code, including comments, semicolons, using the console, and formatting output.

### Variables
- Empty JavaScript Program: Think of an empty JavaScript program as the first level of a sandbox game. It provides an underlying structure for building code.
- Variables: Variables are essential for saving and reusing data in JavaScript.
- Variable Declaration: To declare a variable, use the keyword "var" followed by the variable name (e.g., "var person;"). This informs JavaScript that you want to reuse a specific value.
- Variable Assignment: Assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator "=" (e.g., "person = 'John';"). This associates the variable with the given value.
- Console Output: The "console.log" method is used to output values to the console. You can combine static text with dynamic variables in console.log.
- Reassigning Variables: Variables can be reassigned with new values, allowing you to change their content as needed. For example, you can change "greeting" from "hello" to "hi" or "person" from "John" to "James."
- Power of Variables: Variables enable you to use the same code to produce different results by changing variable values. This flexibility makes programs versatile.

### Exercise: Declaring Variables

### Data types
- Data Types Analogy: Programming is like sorting and packing belongings when moving. It's about efficiently using different data types to store information.
- Primitive Data Types: JavaScript has seven primitive data types: string, number, Boolean, null, undefined, BigInt, and symbol.
- Strings and Numbers: Strings are for text values, while numbers are for numerical values. Distinction between them is important due to different rules.
- Number Data Type: Numbers in JavaScript have a wide range but are limited by JavaScript's calculation capabilities.
- String Data Type: Strings have almost infinite combinations of characters and are great for storing titles and descriptions.
- Other Data Types: The Boolean data type has values "true" and "false" for making decisions. "Null" represents the absence of value, and "undefined" refers to variables with no assigned value.
- ES6 Additions: ES6 introduced two new data types: BigInt for large numbers and symbol for unique identifiers.
- Applying Data Types: Using the right data type for specific values and tasks is essential for efficient coding.

### Operators
- Operators: Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values in JavaScript. They manipulate data items and return results.
- Assignment Operators: Assignment operators are used for simple and complex calculations. They allow you to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Comparison Operators: Comparison operators compare values and return logical values based on the comparison's truth. They include greater than, less than, equal to, and not equal to.
- Logical Operators: Logical operators help determine if something is true or false. "AND" (&&) checks if multiple conditions are true, "OR" (||) checks if at least one condition is true, and "NOT" (!) returns false if the result is true.
- Usage of Operators: Operators are used to control program flow based on certain criteria, making them essential in various programming tasks.
- Demonstration: The text provides examples of using arithmetic and comparison operators in JavaScript, with console.log statements to display the results.

### Numbers
- Number Data Type: The number data type in JavaScript represents both integer and decimal point numbers. It is a foundational part of the language.
- Demonstration: The text provides examples of using the number data type. It shows how to enter integer values (e.g., 123) and decimal values (e.g., 123.456) into the console.
- Mathematical Operations: JavaScript allows you to perform mathematical operations with numbers. The text demonstrates addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponential calculations (**), and the remainder or modulus operator (%).
- Order of Operations: The text explains that you can use parentheses to group more complex calculations. This allows you to control the order of calculations. Without parentheses, JavaScript follows the standard mathematical sequence of calculation.
- Common Mathematical Operators: Some of the most common mathematical operators in JavaScript include plus, minus, times, division, and modulus.

### Strings
- String Data Type: Strings are used to represent and work with a sequence of characters in JavaScript. They are a fundamental data type for handling text.
- String Format: A string in JavaScript is a collection of characters enclosed by either single quotes or double quotes. Strings can contain letters, punctuation symbols, numbers, and other characters.
- Empty String: An empty string is created by using a pair of single quotation marks or a pair of double quotation marks with nothing in between.
- Valid Characters: Strings can include almost any character, and they don't have to be empty. You can create strings with letters, symbols, numbers, or any combination of characters.
- Line Breaks: Strings cannot break onto the next line in your code. Attempting to do so will result in an error.
- Delimiters: The characters (single or double quotes) used to surround string values are referred to as delimiters. They mark the beginning and end of a string value.
- Nesting Quotes: To include quotes within a string, you can nest them. For example, if you want to use an apostrophe within a string enclosed by single quotes, you can nest the string within double quotes to avoid errors.

### Booleans
- Boolean Data Type: The Boolean data type is used to check if a statement is true or false. It's fundamental in JavaScript for making decisions based on the evaluation of conditions.
- Comparison Operators: JavaScript provides various comparison operators for evaluating conditions. For example, the less than operator (<) checks if one value is less than another, and the greater than operator (>) checks if one value is greater than another.
- Two Possible Values: The Boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. It's ideal for situations where you need to determine whether a statement or condition is true or false.
- Equality Operator: JavaScript uses the double equals operator (==) to check if two values are equal. It compares values only and not their data types. For example, 1 == 2 returns false because 1 is not equal to 2.
- Strict Equality Operator: The strict equality operator (===) compares both values and data types. For example, comparing 100 === "100" returns false because the data types are different.
- Inequality Operator: The inequality operator (!=) checks if two values are not equal. For example, 1 != 1 returns false because 1 is equal to 1.
- Strict Inequality Operator: The strict inequality operator (!==) compares both values and data types to determine if they are not equal. For example, 1 !== "1" returns true because the values are not equal.
- Usage Beyond Comparison: While the Boolean data type is crucial for comparisons, it has many other important uses in JavaScript, including making decisions, controlling program flow, and more.

### Operators in Depth:

- Logical AND Operator (&&): The logical AND operator (&&) in JavaScript is used to confirm if multiple comparisons will return true. It requires both the values on its left and right to be evaluated as true to return true. If any one of them is false, it returns false. For example, console.log(10 > 9 && 10 < 17) returns true because both comparisons are true.
- Logical OR Operator (||): The logical OR operator (||) checks if at least one of the given comparisons evaluates to true. It returns true if either the value on its left or right is true. It returns false only when both are false. For example, console.log(7 < 9 || 7 > 17) returns true because the first comparison is true.
- Logical NOT Operator (!): The logical NOT operator (!) is used to invert a boolean value. It changes true to false and false to true. For example, if var petHungry = true, then console.log(!petHungry) will return false.
Modulus Operator (%): The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, console.log(22 % 5) returns 2 because 22 divided by 5 is 4 with a remainder of 2.
- Equality Operator (==): The equality operator (==) checks if two values are equal. It compares values only, not their data types. For example, console.log(5 == "5") returns true because the values are equal.
- Strict Equality Operator (===): The strict equality operator (===) compares both values and data types. For example, console.log(5 === 5) returns true, but console.log(5 === "5") returns false because the data types are different.
- Inequality Operator (!=): The inequality operator (!=) checks if two values are not equal. It does not check for differences in data types. For example, console.log(5 != "5") returns false.
- Strict Inequality Operator (!==): The strict inequality operator (!==) checks for both value and data type differences. For example, console.log(5 !== "5") returns true.

#### Using the + Operators:

- Combining Strings using +: The + operator can be used to join (concatenate) string values together. For example, "inter" + "net" results in "internet."
- Combining Strings and Numbers using +: When combining a string and a number using the + operator, JavaScript converts the number to a string and then concatenates them. For example, 365 + " days" results in "365 days."
- Addition Assignment Operator (+=): The addition assignment operator (+=) is used to accumulate values in a variable. It simplifies code by adding new values to an existing variable.
- Coercion: JavaScript automatically performs type conversion (coercion) to handle operations between different data types. For example, when adding a number and a string, JavaScript coerces the number to a string and then concatenates them.
- Operator Precedence: Operator precedence defines the order in which operators are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. For example, 1 * 2 + 3 results in 5 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition.
- Operator Associativity: Operator associativity determines the order in which operators are evaluated when they have the same precedence. For example, the assignment operator is right-to-left associative, and the greater than operator is left-to-right associative. 

### Js History and improvement

- JavaScript's Origins:

JavaScript was created in a mere 10 days in 1995 by Brendan Eich. It was initially designed as a simple scripting language to be used in version 2 of the Netscape browser.
Originally named "LiveScript," it was later renamed "JavaScript" due to the popularity of the Java language, even though the two are unrelated.
- Early JavaScript Usage:

In its early days, JavaScript served as a simple scripting language primarily used for adding interactive features, such as mouseover effects, to webpages.
These interactive effects were added to webpages using the <script> HTML element, where JavaScript code could be placed.
- ECMAScript and Standardization:

In 1996, Netscape collaborated with ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) to draft the specification of the JavaScript language.
In 1997, the first edition of the ECMAScript specification was published, which defined how JavaScript should work. This specification is known as ECMA-262, and it serves as a standard for JavaScript.
- Evolution and ECMAScript Updates:

Since the initial publication of ECMAScript, there have been 12 updates to the standard, with the first one released in 1997.
JavaScript's evolution has made it one of the most commonly used programming languages today.
- JavaScript Engines:

JavaScript is not a standalone entity but exists as an implementation within JavaScript engines.
Traditionally, JavaScript engines were part of web browsers, providing the means to execute JavaScript code. JavaScript code allowed interaction with the engine.
- Interactions Beyond the Engine:

In addition to interacting with the JavaScript engine, developers can use JavaScript to interact with other browser functionalities outside the engine. These functionalities are known as Browser APIs.
- Node.js and JavaScript's Versatility:

In 2009, Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js, enabling JavaScript to be used as a standalone entity. This opened new possibilities, allowing JavaScript to run outside of web browsers as a separate program, on the command line, or as a server-side environment.
JavaScript is now a versatile language running not only in web browsers but also on servers and across various devices with JavaScript engines.
