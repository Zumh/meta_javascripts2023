## Java scripts Basic notes

### Comments in JavaScript

Two types: Single-line comments and Multi-line comments.
Syntax for single-line comments: // this is a comment!
Syntax for multi-line comments:
arduino
Copy code
/*
this
is
a
multi-line
comment
*/
Why Writing Comments is Empowering

Allows you to express ideas about code.
Can be added to existing code for future reference.
Facilitates communication with team members.
Can be used for explanations, questions, marking code as "to do" or "to improve," or for debugging.

### The Semi-colon in JavaScript
Similar to a period in English, used to delimit parts of the code.
Automatic Semi-Colon Insertion (ASI) can fill in missing semi-colons, making them somewhat optional.

### Using the Console in Developer Tools
JavaScript can be executed in the browser's Developer Tools.
Use Google Chrome for this course.
Pressing SHIFT + ENTER allows typing multiple lines of code before running.
Outputting a Greeting in the Console

Use console.log("Hello, World"); to output "Hello, World" in the console.
Can style the output using CSS with %c.
Outputting Multiple Words in the Console

### Join multiple words (+)
Join multiple words using + or use , to separate them in console.log().
These points cover the main concepts discussed in the text. Remember to practice these concepts to solidify your understanding.

## VARIABLES
Efficient Moving Process Analogy:

Sorting items
Packing into boxes
Labeling boxes
Placing boxes in respective rooms
Programming and Data Types Analogy:

Efficient coding = Knowing when/where to use data types
7 Primitive Data Types in JavaScript:
String
Number
Boolean
Null
Undefined
BigInt
Symbol
Strings and Numbers:

Example: E-commerce app for guitars
Name, Description -> String
Price -> Number
Understanding Data:

All values collectively referred to as data
Values need to be stored differently based on their nature
String vs. Number:

Building a number is straightforward
Building a string requires enclosing characters in quotes
Data Storage Capabilities:

Number: Wide range, but limited by JavaScript's calculations
String: Practically unlimited combinations of characters
App Example Data Types:

Price -> Number
Name, Description -> Strings (in double quotes)
Choosing Data Types:

Strings for titles and descriptions
Numbers for values to be calculated
Additional Data Types:

Boolean: True or False (for decisions)
Null: Represents absence of value
Undefined: Refers to unassigned variable
ES6 Introduces New Data Types:

BigInt: Accommodates a greater range of numbers than Number
Symbol: Unique identifier (like serial numbers on boxes)
Final Note:

Understanding when to use each data type is crucial for efficient coding. Knowing the specific use cases of each data type will improve your coding skills.
